# Kaggle - Titanic Challenge
## Machine Learning from Disaster

This project uses the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) Kaggle Challenge to use data to predict whether a person that was in the Titanic survived or not to the disaster.

The purpose of this project was to apply new knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks, as well as to practice new tools of the TensorFlow, pandas and Scikit-Learn.

The different programs try different approaches to the problem and achieve different accuracies.

## Data format

* *survival* : 1 if the person survived, 0 otherwise. It is the variable to be predicted
* *pclass*: Descbribes the ticket class. It is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
  * 1st = Upper
  * 2nd = Middle
  * 3rd = Lower
* *age*: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
* *sibsp*: The dataset defines the number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic family relations in this way:
  * Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
  * Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
* *parch*: The dataset defines the number of parents/children aboard the Titanic family relations in this way:
  * Parent = mother, father
  * Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
  * Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
* *ticket* : Ticket number
* *fare* : Passenger fare
* *cabin* : Cabin number
* *embarked* : Port of Embarkation
  * C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

## Models

* Titanic 1
  * Model: RandomForestClassifier from Sckit-learn
  * Features: Sex and Age to predict the model
  * Accuracy of 0.71291
* Titanic 2
